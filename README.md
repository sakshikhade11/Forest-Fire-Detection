# Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²

This project is about detecting forest fires using deep learning. I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either "fire" or "no fire". The goal is to help with early detection of forest fires, which can reduce damage and improve response time.

## Features

- Detects fire in images using CNN
- Trained on a fire/no-fire image dataset
- Used data augmentation to improve model accuracy
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

- Used a public dataset from Kaggle
- Two classes: Fire and No Fire
